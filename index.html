              <hr>
              Farmers without small fortunes for expensive machinery are faced with the challenge of manually refilling
              animal water troughs. Considering how large the animal headcount on a farm can be, this manual process can
              waste a lot time that could be better spent doing more productive work. Additionally, there are facts
              presented by the patterns of water taken by animals on a regular basis, facts which remain unseen because
              farmers are unable to collect the data needed to identify these patterns.

              As a solution to this problem, we propose an embedded system specifically designed to automatically refill
              the animal water troughs, track how much water is taken regularly and uniquely identify which animals have
              taken water and by elimination which animals haven’t.

              <h3>Water Level Tracking</h3>


              The system tracks the level water in the rough in real time using an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic
              sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an
              object’s proximity (the surface of the water, in this case). It sends an ultrasonic pulse which travels
              through the air and if there is an obstacle or object, it will bounce back to the sensor. By calculating
              the travel time and the speed of sound, the distance can be calculated. And from this distance, the water
              level can be tracked

              <h3>Automatic Water Supply</h3>

              With the water level tracking functionality, the system is able to tell when the tank is full and when it
              is empty. When the tank is empty, the system passes current through the brushless water pump to
              automatically refill the trough by pumping water from the water source (tank). When the tank is full on
              refilling it the water supply is cut off by stopping the current through the brushless water pump.

              <h3>Animal Identification</h3>

              When an animal comes to take water from the trough, the RFID reader detects the RFID tags attached to the
              animal. The RFID tags have unique tags which are read by the RFID reader to uniquely identify the animal
              that is presently taking water.

              <h3>Server Data Storage</h3>

              The system uses a GSM module and its GPRS functionality to send collected data to the server hosted by
              thingsspeak.com.


              <h3>Mobile Application Statistics</h3>

              A mobile application client requests for statistics information from the server and displays it to the
              user. The application shows information like daily water intake, cows that haven’t taken water and daily
              number of refills.
